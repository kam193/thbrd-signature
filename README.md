</p>

This extension allows you to easily synchronize signature of selected accounts
in Thunderbird with your Gmail accounts. **Syncronization works in one way**,
your local signatures are overridden by Gmail ones.

In order to sync a signature, go to the settings page, enable an account and
connect it with Gmail. Signatures are downloaded on every startup or when you
click in settings.

> **Beta!** This is still a beta version. It can work unstable.

## Run from source
