## Signature sync for Gmail, a Thunderbird add-on

This extension allows you to easily update signature of selected accounts
in Thunderbird with the signature from your Gmail accounts.
**Syncronization works in one way**, your local signatures are overridden by Gmail ones.

In order to sync a signature, go to the settings page, enable an account and
connect it with Gmail. Signatures are downloaded on every startup or when you
click in settings.

> **Beta!** This is still a beta version. It can work unstable.
